# Upcycling POS Devices
__Upcycling, repurpose and renew old Point-Of-Sale (POS) displays and printers__

__Vacuum-Fluorescent-Displays__ (VFD) and __receipt printers__  are used since over 30 years on cash stations (__Point-Of-Sale__ - POS) from many manufacturers. Now they are replaced by newer and modern displays (TFT). The old ones are often offered by eBay and other platforms for a very low and DIY-friendly price. Sometimes the replacement of POS-systems is forced by local law, so the device are in a (near) unused condition or even unpacked (NOS). This can bring the VFDs and printers to a __second life__ in new __artworks__ (e.g. steampunk, atompunk), stylish __computer/server add-ons__ and __LARP__ sceneries.

This project provides technical descriptions to __connect__ and __power__ the devices as well as the needed __escape-sequences__ to control them. Also interesting project examples can be found here.

You also find here example __source code__ for __PC__ and __Raspberry Pi__ to communicate with this devices.
